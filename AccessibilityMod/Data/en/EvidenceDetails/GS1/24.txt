A crumpled, white sheet of note paper bearing a typed name and large handwritten numbers is displayed against a solid grey background.

The paper is rectangular and oriented vertically in the center of the frame. Deep creases intersect at the middle, forming a cross shape that divides the sheet into four quadrants. These lines indicate the paper was previously folded into quarters. The texture appears slightly wrinkled throughout, suggesting it has been handled or crumpled before being flattened out for viewing.

In the upper right corner, the name "Goodman" is printed in a small, bold, grey typeface. Immediately below the name, a fine grey line runs horizontally across the width of the page, acting as a header separator.

Two lines of large, thick handwritten characters, written in black marker, dominate the center of the page. The top line reads "6-7S". The bottom line reads "12/2". The writing is centered, crossing over the intersection of the fold lines.
