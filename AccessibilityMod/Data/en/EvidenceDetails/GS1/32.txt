A flat, animatronic-style standee of a blue mascot character stands on a wheeled cart in front of a building entrance.

The figure, known as the "Blue Badger," has a large, pale, disc-shaped face with wide, staring eyes and a simple curved smile. It wears a blue hood with three jester-like prongs, each tipped with a yellow ball. Notably, the prong on the left side of the image is damaged and has been repaired with a visible piece of tape or cloth near the base. On the opposite side of the face, a faint, grey handprint smudge is visible on the cheek.

The body is blue and segmented, with limbs attached by visible pivot joints, suggesting crude mechanical movement. It wears a brown belt with a silver buckle and a sash striped with green, yellow, and white running diagonally across its chest. In its right hand (left side of the image), it holds a red baton downward. In its left hand, it holds a small, rectangular yellow flag.

The entire figure is mounted on a metal pole attached to a small, four-wheeled dolly resting on a tiled pavement. The background features the grey metal frames and glass doors of a modern building, obscured slightly by a large white cylindrical pillar standing directly behind the mascot. To the left, a green bush and part of a bulletin board are visible.
