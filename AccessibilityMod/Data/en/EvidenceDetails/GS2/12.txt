A triumphant magician holds a golden trophy aloft on a brightly lit stage, flanked by two assistants in bunny costumes.

The magician stands in the center, wearing his signature purple top hat, open tailcoat with pink lapels, and tight purple trousers. He smiles broadly with his eyes closed, raising a large gold cup trophy high in his left hand. A playing card, the Queen of Hearts, is tucked into the waistband of his pants.

Two women wearing pink leotards, white collars, cuffs, and bunny ears stand on either side of him. The woman on the left has red hair, and the woman on the right has blonde hair. Both extend their arms toward the magician in a presenting gesture.

To the right of the magician, a green-tinted bust sits on a white architectural pedestal. The sculpture depicts a man wearing a top hat and holding a fan of playing cards in his hand. The background is washed in intense multicolored stage lights—red, green, and cyan—creating a dazzling array of lens flares and white sparkles throughout the scene.
