A shiny, green bust of a magician stands against a dark background, arms crossed and holding fans of cards.

The sculpture is rendered in a monochromatic green tone with high-contrast highlights. The figure depicts a man wearing a tall top hat with a feather tucked into the band. On the cheek visible to the right, two star-shaped markings are engraved. He wears a suit with a high, flared collar.

His arms are crossed in an "X" shape over his chest. In each hand, he holds a fan of four blank white playing cards, splayed out to the left and right. Stylized white lens flares and sparkles surround the cards and the hat, emphasizing the object's reflective surface.

The bust rests on a grey rectangular pedestal base. A gold plaque attached to the front bears the inscription "The Greatest Magician" in a dark, cursive font.
