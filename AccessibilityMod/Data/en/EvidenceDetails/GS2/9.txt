A person wearing a formal tailcoat is collapsed face-down over a wooden box in the snow.

The figure is positioned centrally, kneeling in the snow with their torso bent forward at a ninety-degree angle, draped completely over a large, upright wooden box. The position obscures the person's head and chest. They wear a dark suit jacket with long tails featuring two buttons at the waist, dark trousers, and dress shoes. Their left arm hangs loosely down the side of the box, with the hand resting on the snowy surface.

The box appears to be made of a light-colored wood with reinforced corners. A handle and latch are visible on the left side of the box. The ground is covered in a thick layer of snow.

A trail of deep footprints leads from the victim's feet toward the bottom right corner of the image, suggesting movement away from the body.
