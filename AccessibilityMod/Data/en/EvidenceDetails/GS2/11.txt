A flamboyant magician in a purple costume flies horizontally through the air, trailing a massive red-lined cape and magical sparkles.

The magician, who appears to be suspended in mid-flight against a dark, blurred arena background, wears a tall purple top hat adorned with a large green feather. He has long pink hair and a red star design painted over his left eye. His purple tailcoat features wide pink lapels, each pinned with a white rose. The coat hangs open, revealing his bare chest, abdominal muscles, and several gold necklaces.

A large playing card, the Queen of Hearts, is tucked into the left side of his waist. He wears tight purple trousers and purple platform shoes decorated with diamond and club symbols. His left arm reaches forward, emitting a cluster of white sparkles, while his right gloved hand touches the brim of his hat. A bright blue aura outlines his entire figure.
